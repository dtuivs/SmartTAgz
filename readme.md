So this was original built in iOS's Shortcuts. Decided to give it a shot with a desktop evironment but there is definitely some backward compatibility with how I wrote the iOS shortcuts. There Should be a version for MacOS and a version compiled for Raspberry Pi 64bit.  

Still currently a work in progress...
