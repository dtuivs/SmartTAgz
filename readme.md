SmartTAgz (Register App)

So this was original built in iOS's Shortcuts. Decided to give it a shot with a desktop evironment but there is definitely some backward compatibility with how I wrote the iOS shortcuts. I'm Intending on compiling for the raspberry pi with the Touch diplay but that's another project. 

Still currently a work in progress...


This Last update:

- Hide Keypad option
- new persistence file where all the other options will be migrated to for future expansion and scaling
- shows full path for current ticket in settings now
- App Icon should show up now
